<h3 id="secure-outsourced-middleboxes">Secure Outsourced Middleboxes</h3>

<p>Middleboxes are essential for a wide range of advanced traffic processing in enterprise networks. The trend of deploying middleboxes in public clouds as virtualized services further expands potential benefits of middleboxes while avoiding local maintenance burdens. Despite promising, middlebox outsourcing is facing crucial security challenges. Traffic now is redirect to cloud, where the traffic content and proprietary middlebox rules are exposed. On the other hand, these boxes are no longer under the direct control of enterprises. It is desirable to ensure that these boxes function as intended.</p>

Cloud Middlebox Service Architecture
</div>

<ol>
  <li>How to design a secure middlebox system that performs network functions without revealing either packet payloads or rules?</li>
  <li>How to devise practical mechanisms that provide runtime execution assurance of outsourced middleboxes with high confidence?</li>
</ol>

<p>Fulfilling those requirements will ease enterprises privacy and security concerns, extend their visibility into remote middleboxes, and promote further adoption of NFV services. Preliminary results that address the above questions are published in <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7524526/?arnumber=7524526">IEEE INFOCOM’16</a> and <a href="">IEEE ICNP’16</a>.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-assured-similarity-search-for-large-scale-applications">Privacy-assured Similarity Search for Large-scale Applications</h3>

<p>Big data are usually drawn from varieties of forms: not just texts, but also images, audio, video, and other information-rich content, which are usually represented as high-dimensional data records. In this context, similarity queries are more desired than exact-match queries. Meanwhile, multimedia data often contain sensitive or personal information. Thus, enabling secure content-aware query processing over encrypted multimedia data is very demanding. Yet, most prior solutions on encrypted search are for exact-match queries.</p>

Privacy-preserving Image Querying Service
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>To bridge the gap, we first note that this problem could be theoretically handled by a direct combination of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and searchable symmetric encryption (SSE), where LSH is a well-studied algorithm for fast similarity search, and SSE is a widely adopted security framework for encrypted search. By treating LSH hash value(s) as keyword(s), one may apply known SSE schemes to realize secure similarity search. However, we observed that due to the imbalance of LSH, such a straightforward solution does not achieve practical scalability and efficiency as the sizes of datasets are continuously growing. Rather than just assembling off-the-shelf designs in a blackbox manner, we consider security, space utilization, time efficiency, and search accuracy simultaneously, and develop new constructions from the ground up. The results are published in <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24177-7_3">ESORICS’15</a> and <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6888896/?arnumber=6888896">IEEE ICDCS’14</a>.</p>

<h3 id="encrypted-search-techniques-for-compressed-signals-with-fast-indexing">Encrypted Search Techniques for Compressed Signals with Fast Indexing</h3>

<p>In many application domains, e.g., sensors/monitoring systems and auditing systems, huge volumes of data containing sensitive/private information are being collected and stored in high rates. For example, in remote healthcare applications, a transceiver monitoring physiological signal of an individual can produce up to 31 GB data per day. How to quickly acquire and index those data and make them promptly available for search and utilization inevitably becomes a critical demand. Given the security protection, the high velocity, and the heterogeneity of big data, such a practical requirement makes the design even more challenging.</p>

Privacy-preserving Healthcare Monitoring System
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>To address those challenges, we proposed a secure cloud-based storage framework that allows fast data acquisition and indexing with strong privacy assurance. we first focus on the promising compressive sensing framework, for its well-known time and energy efficient data acquisition, with easy data sampling, compression, and recovery. The key observation is that the Euclidean norm of raw data is still preserved in the measurement space of compressed samples. Starting from there, we build a fast and encrypted index for compressed samples, which makes secure search over encrypted yet compressed data possible. In particular, for high throughput of indexing, we develop new encrypted index designs that take into account both the security guarantees of encrypted search as well as high-performance content-based indexing, and novel concurrent programming algorithms. The result is published in <a href="">IEEE TMM</a>.</p>

<h3 id="encrypted-distributed-data-store">Encrypted Distributed Data Store</h3>

<p>In order to manage the persistently growing amount of data, distributed data stores have become the backbone of many public cloud services. However, with increasing data breaches, privacy concerns in data outsourcing become even more pressing than before. To address those concerns, we start from the most widely adopted data store, i.e., key-value stores, and build an encrypted, distributed, and searchable key-value store. Specifically, we cope with the following challenges so that the proposed system will not sacrifice the benefits of existing systems.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to securely distribute encrypted data across distributed nodes?</li>
  <li>How to design an overlay that supports multiple data models with strong security guarantees?</li>
  <li>How to design a framework for encrypted and distributed indexes that enable secure queries on secondary attributes of data?</li>
</ol>

<br />
Encrypted Key-value Store Architecture
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Our proposed encrypted key-value store achieves strong protection on data privacy while preserving prominent features of key-value stores. It is built on a secure data partition algorithm that distributes encrypted data evenly across a cluster of nodes. It also supports multiple data models in a privacy-preserving manner. To enable secure queries for encrypted secondary attributes of data, our design provides searchable encryption based encrypted secondary indexes which consider security, efficiency, and data locality simultaneously. The preliminary result is published in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2897852">ACM ASIACCS’16</a>.</p>

<h3 id="secure-content-delivery-via-encrypted-in-network-caching">Secure Content Delivery via Encrypted In-network Caching</h3>

<p>To handle the exponential growth of media content, new network architectures along the direction of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) have been proposed. Storing data in advanced network devices such as cache-enabled routers, benefits like reduced content access latency are well appreciated. However, due to potentially wide attacking surfaces, caching data in the increasingly untrustworthy networked environment raises new concerns on user privacy exposure and unauthorized data access.</p>

Content Delivery Service via Encrypted In-network Caching
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>To address these concerns, we designed new networked systems for secure and efficient content dissemination through encrypted in-network caching. To move one-step further towards practice, we consider the effective support of content dissemination from multiple providers to authorized users, and study how to efficiently enable authorized search across encrypted in-network content from multiple providers under their own different keys. To broaden the application scenarios, our system also supports advanced content-aware data dissemination scenarios by incorporating the content near-duplicate detection into our encrypted in-network cache system. Preliminary results are published in <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7485895/?arnumber=7485895">IEEE JSAC</a> and <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7524346/?arnumber=7524346">IEEE INFOCOM’16</a>.</p>
