### Overview

I am a PostdocÂ in the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.monash.edu/it) at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/about/), and affiliated with the [Monash Cybersecurity Lab](http://www.monash.edu/cybersecurity-lab). I earned my PhD degree from [City University of Hong Kong](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/) under the direction of the incomparable [Way Kuo](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/op/bio_en.htm) and [Min Xie](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/seem/minxie/) in 2017.

<br />
My research interests include cloud and network security with recent focus on encrypted search and secure networked systems. My research is currently supported by government, university, as well as industry sectors, including Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Commission, Monash University, Oceania Cyber Security Centre, Microsoft Azure, and Collinstar Capital.

<!-- <br />
I am always looking for outstanding students; please email me your CV and supporting documents. More details on PhD applications can be found [here](http://www.monash.edu/graduate-research/future-students/apply), [here](https://www.monash.edu/graduate-research/future-students/support/international-students/china-scholarship-council), and [here](https://xyuancs.github.io/PhD-adv.md).  -->
