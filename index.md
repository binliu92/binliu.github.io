### Overview

I am a Postdocal fellow in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/civil-environmental-engineering/) at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/about/). I earned my PhD degree from [City University of Hong Kong](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/) under the direction of the incomparable [Way Kuo](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/op/bio_en.htm) and [Min Xie](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/seem/minxie/) in 2017. 

<br />
I focus on the research of system engineering and the associated decision making of complex systems for the purpose of improving operational performance. I am interested in the discovery of uncertainty and performance improvement of complex systems. Currently my research interests include reliability and risk assessment, degradation and resilience analysis, decision making under uncertainty, and data analysis.
